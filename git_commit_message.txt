fix: Resolve Generate Learning Path button not working in production

- Fix ES module export/import issue in learningPath.js
- Improve environment detection in config.js to work in both dev and prod
- Add fallback mechanism for script loading in index.html
- Add error handling and user feedback for button click events

This commit addresses the issue where the Generate Learning Path button
works in development but fails in production. The root causes were:
1. Inconsistent module exports preventing proper initialization
2. Environment detection relying on process.env which isn't available in browsers
3. Lack of error handling for script loading failures

The solution ensures the button works correctly in all environments by:
1. Properly exporting the learningPathManager instance
2. Using window.location.hostname to detect environment
3. Adding fallback UI for error cases

Testing: Verified button functionality in both development and production environments.
